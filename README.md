# Ft_ssl
This project is a learning project based on the 42 projects. The goal is to learn about hashing algorithm and encryption.

# Todo
- [ ] Implement command ./ft_ssl md5
- [ ] Make it work for Big endian
- [ ] Check the edge case where there is just room for padding the length. What about the first 1 bit

# Testing
I use CUnit. Here is how to install the framework.

sudo apt-get install libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev
```

How to use it
